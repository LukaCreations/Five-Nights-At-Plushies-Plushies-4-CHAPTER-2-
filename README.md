# Five-Nights-At-Plushies-Plushies-4-CHAPTER-2-
-STORY-  The year is 1994. You, Dave Coleton, a worker that used to work at Showbiz Pizza Place have accepted a job at Fredbear's Daycare, FAZBEAR'S K-12 COMPANY's 1st Standalone establishment. (It's a daycare where kids from the ages of 5-11 can roleplay with the plushies: Fredbear, Springbonnie, Springfred and the Plush Police DUO and you can get some additional help from Helpfred, the state-of-the-art helpful animatronic while your there and it obviously has teachers, like daycares always do) On your first night there, you didn't know what to expect until you got a phone call from your guide. When you knew what to do, you checked the cameras and saw that one of the plushies are missing. If the plushies or some other robot gets you, they will never let you go.  YOUR PROBABLY ASKING ME: Why are you making CHAPTER 2 to the 4th Game?  Because FNAF PLUSHIES 4 Origins was originally gonna take place 3 Years before the events of FNAF PLUSHIES 1 V1-4 and this game is basically gonna be a revival of what i originally intended FNAF PLUSHIES 4 to be like.
